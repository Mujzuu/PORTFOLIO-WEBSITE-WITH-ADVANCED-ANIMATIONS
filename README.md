In this task, a fully functional and visually appealing portfolio website was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the GSAP animation library. The goal was to build a static personal portfolio with modern design and scroll-based animations to showcase projects, blog posts, and web development services.

🔧 Step 1: Project Setup
The development began by creating a basic HTML structure with a fixed top navigation bar linking to various sections: Home, Projects, Services, Blog, and Contact. The header featured an introduction with a bold headline and a short subtext describing the user. The layout was designed to be clean, responsive, and user-friendly.

🎨 Step 2: Styling with CSS
Custom styling was applied using an external style.css file. The theme was dark, with blue and purple accents to maintain a sleek modern look. Typography used Google Fonts (Roboto), and all sections had consistent padding, spacing, and rounded cards for a polished UI. Special attention was given to responsiveness, ensuring the layout works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

⚙️ Step 3: Adding Projects & Services Sections
A Projects section was created to list highlight-worthy projects with brief titles such as “AI Resume Generator,” “Personal Learning Tracker,” and “E-commerce UI/UX Prototype.” Then, a Services section was added in place of the default “Skills” section, describing core offerings like Web Design, Frontend Development, and Performance Optimization. Each entry was styled as a card for uniformity and readability.

📝 Step 4: Blog Section
Instead of testimonials, a Blog section was added. It showcased animated blog post summaries such as “Animating with GSAP” and “Building for Performance.” These sections help demonstrate thought leadership and technical expertise.

✏️ Step 5: Contact Form & Footer
A functional and styled Contact Form was built using HTML form inputs and a submit button. Though non-functional in this static version, it acts as a placeholder for future backend integration. A simple footer was added at the bottom with a copyright message.

🎞️ Step 6: GSAP Animations
Using GSAP and ScrollTrigger, animations were added to make the portfolio interactive and engaging. Headings and cards fade or slide into view as users scroll down. JavaScript code was separated into script.js and handles all the animations modularly.

🗂️ Step 7: Code Organization & Optimization
The code was refactored into three separate files:

index.html for structure

style.css for styling

script.js for behavior and animations

All code followed clean structure, semantic HTML, reusable CSS classes, and modular JavaScript to allow easy updates and scalability.
